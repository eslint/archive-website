# Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

A CLA is a document that specifies how a project is allowed to use your code. We've put a lot of work into creating a CLA that is simple, effective, and as clear as possible so that it doesn't disrupt contributions to ESLint.

When you make a contribution to the ESLint project, you agree:

1. The code you wrote is your original work (you own the copyright) or you otherwise have the right to submit the work.
1. To grant the ESLint project a nonexclusive, irrevocable license to use your submitted code in any way.
1. You are capable of granting these rights for the contribution.
