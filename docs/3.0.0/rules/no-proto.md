# Disallow Use of `__proto__` (no-proto)

`__proto__` property has been deprecated as of ECMAScript 3.1 and shouldn't be used in the code. Use `getPrototypeOf` method instead.

## Rule Details

When an object is created `__proto__` is set to the original prototype property of the objectâ€™s constructor function. `getPrototypeOf` is the preferred method of getting "the prototype".

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```js
/*eslint no-proto: "error"*/

var a = obj.__proto__;

var a = obj["__proto__"];
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```js
/*eslint no-proto: "error"*/

var a = Object.getPrototypeOf(obj);
```

## When Not To Use It

If you need to support legacy browsers, you might want to turn this rule off, since support for `getPrototypeOf` is not yet universal.

## Version

This rule was introduced in ESLint 0.0.9.
