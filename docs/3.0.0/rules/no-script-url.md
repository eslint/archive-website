# Disallow Script URLs (no-script-url)

Using `javascript:` URLs is considered by some as a form of `eval`. Code passed in `javascript:` URLs has to be parsed and evaluated by the browser in the same way that `eval` is processed.

## Rule Details

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```js
/*eslint no-script-url: "error"*/

location.href = "javascript:void(0)";
```

## Compatibility

* **JSHint**: This rule corresponds to `scripturl` rule of JSHint.
