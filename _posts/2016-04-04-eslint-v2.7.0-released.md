# ESLint v2.7.0 released

We just pushed ESLint v2.7.0, which is a minor release upgrade of ESLint. This release adds some new features and fixes several bugs found in the previous release.
This release was meant to be a patch v2.6.1 release, but the version was incorrectly calculated due to a bug in our release tool.
