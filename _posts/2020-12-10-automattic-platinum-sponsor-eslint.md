We are happy to share that [Automattic](https://automattic.com) has become ESLint's first platinum sponsor, donating $2,000 each month for the ongoing maintenance and development of ESLint! Automattic is the company behind <a href="https://wordpress.com">WordPress.com</a>, <a href="https://woocommerce.com">WooCommerce</a>, <a href="https://jetpack.com">Jetpack</a>, <a href="https://simplenote.com/">Simplenote</a>, <a href="https://longreads.com/">Longreads</a>, <a href="https://vaultpress.com/">VaultPress</a>, <a href="https://akismet.com/">Akismet</a>, <a href="https://en.gravatar.com/">Gravatar</a>, <a href="https://crowdsignal.com/">Crowdsignal</a>, <a href="https://cloudup.com/">Cloudup</a>, <a href="https://www.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a>, and more. Further, Automattic believes  in open source and makes a lot of their work [public on GitHub](https://github.com/Automattic) and available via the GPL.

Here's what Automattic engineers told us about ESLint:

> "ESLint helps us keep our code consistent and clean across hundreds of developers."
> <br>-- Marcus Kazmierczak, Engineering Team Lead, Automattic
>
> "ESLint lets me apply my brain to more important things."
> <br>-- Darren Ethier, Engineering Team Lead, Automattic
>
> "Unlike my variables, ESLint is always used."
> <br>-- Nadir Seghir, JavaScript Engineer, Automattic

ESLint is honored and excited to be the first project that Automattic has sponsored through Open Collective. Support from companies like Automattic is why ESLint has been able to grow with the JavaScript ecosystem even after seven years in a rapidly changing landscape.

A special thanks to [Sarah Gooding](https://wptavern.com/author/sarah) of [WPTavern](https://wptavern.com/) for her excellent article, [ESLint Maintainers Share Challenges of Funding Open Source Utilities through Sponsorship ](https://wptavern.com/eslint-maintainers-share-challenges-of-funding-open-source-utilities-through-sponsorship). We heard from Automattic that it was this article that put ESLint on the team's radar. We are grateful both for the coverage and the insights shared about funding open source projects.
