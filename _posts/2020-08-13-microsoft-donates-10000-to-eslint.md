We are happy to share that [Microsoft](https://microsoft.com) has donated $10,000 to the ESLint project as part of their [FOSS Fund](https://github.com/microsoft-sponsorships/microsoft-foss-fund/blob/main/README.md). Similar to the [Indeed FOSS Contributor Fund](https://eslint.org/blog/2019/09/indeed-donates-10000-to-eslint) and [Salesforce FOSS Contributor Fund](https://eslint.org/blog/2020/08/salesforce-donates-10000-to-eslint), the Microsoft FOSS Fund donates $10,000 to qualifying open source projects each quarter. Microsoft employees who have contributed to an open source project that is both used by Microsoft and not an official Microsoft project may nominate and vote on potential project recipients.ESLint is honored to be the first recipient from the Microsoft FOSS Fund!

Here's a little more about the Microsoft FOSS Fund (from their [README](https://github.com/microsoft-sponsorships/microsoft-foss-fund/blob/main/README.md)):

> Microsoft is proud to be participating in open source communities more than ever before, whether contributing to projects, releasing new open source projects, or using open source to make our products and services work better for the world and our customers.
>
> While Microsoft and its many teams sponsor everything from open source conferences to contributing to foundations like the Open Source Initiative (OSI) and industry groups such as the Linux Foundation, we hope that the FOSS Fund can help to connect to a new set of projects that we may not have thought to fund in the past, providing real value to communities and projects that help power Microsoft products, services, and our customers.

We are grateful to the Microsoft employees who nominated and voted for ESLint. Already because of donations like these, ESLint has been able to hire our first part-time maintainer and convert our website from Jekyll to Eleventy. Financial support from companies like Microsoft, Salesforce, and Indeed are what will allow ESLint to be maintained and serve the JavaScript community for the foreseeable future.
