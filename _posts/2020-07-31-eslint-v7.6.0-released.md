# ESLint v7.6.0 released

We just pushed ESLint v7.6.0, which is a minor release upgrade of ESLint. This release adds some new features and fixes several bugs found in the previous release.


## Highlights

### `RuleTester` requires `meta.fixable` for fixable rules

Fixable rules are required to have a `meta.fixable` property. A bug in the `RuleTester` class (which is intended to help plugin authors write and test custom rules) was recently surfaced in which fixable rules that do not export metadata (the `meta` property) are not validated for the existence of a `meta.fixable` property, while rules that do export `meta` are.

This has been fixed in this release! Unfortunately, this can lead to new errors being reported by the `RuleTester` for rules that apply fixes and are missing a `meta` property. Please feel free to stop by our [help channel](https://eslint.org/chat/help) if you need assistance resolving this issue.
