# ESLint 0.20.0 released

We just pushed ESLint 0.20.0, which is a minor release upgrade. This release includes new features and bug fixes.

## Highlights

This is a summary of the major changes you need to know about for this version of ESLint.

### Updating Rules for ECMAScript 6

We're still getting a fair number of bug reports related to specific ECMAScript 6 features. The good news is that the bug report rate has slowed dramatically, so we're getting to a much more stable place in terms of ES6 support. Keep those bug reports coming!

### Scoped Plugin Support

This release adds support for scoped npm modules (beginning with `@eslint/`, for example). This is a new feature that npm recently released, and we're happy to follow up by allowing you to use scoped packages as ESLint plugins. See [#2360](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/2360) for more information.

### 1.0.0 Update

With the ESTree changes in, we just have a few outstanding issues before releasing 1.0.0. Those issues are:

* [#2302](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/2302) - create a way to bootstrap `.eslintrc` files for new users
* [#2284](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/2284) - should we switch to using 1-based column numbers instead of 0-based column numbers?
* [#2226](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/2226) - split space-in-brackets rule; implement array-literal-spacing and computed-property-spacing rules.
* [#2225](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/2225) - split space-in-brackets rule; implement curly-braces-spacing rule.

Reminder: we are preparing a list of breaking changes that will be coming in v1.0.0 and are tracking them on [[[#1898](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/1898)](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/1898)](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/1898). Stay tuned to that issue so you know what to expect.
