 This release includes a [security fix](https://github.com/mysticatea/eslint-utils/security/advisories/GHSA-3gx7-xhv7-5mx3) in the `eslint-utils` package, which is a dependency of ESLint. The security issue affects users that run ESLint on untrusted source code (e.g. servers that lint the user's project as a service). By taking advantage of a bug in a certain piece of analysis, a user could supply malicious source text that causes arbitrary code to be executed in the linting process.

* This issue affects versions of `eslint-utils` between v1.2.0 and v1.4.0.
* ESLint versions between v5.3.0 and v6.2.0 are potentially vulnerable (their allowed dependencies include vulnerable `eslint-utils` versions). However, these versions of ESLint can still be used safely if the `eslint-utils` dependency is updated to the latest version (e.g. by updating `eslint-utils` in a lockfile, or purging `node_modules` and reinstalling).
* ESLint v6.2.1 is not vulnerable to the issue.
