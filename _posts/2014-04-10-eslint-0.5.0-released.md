# ESLint 0.5.0 released

We just pushed ESLint 0.5.0, which introduces some new functionality as well as some breaking changes. Please read this notice carefully.

Special thanks to Brandon Mills and George Zahariev for their working on making the CLI even more awesome, and Michael Ficarra for his help and advice on improving runtime performance.

## Breaking Changes

* In previous versions, ESLint would read `/*jshint node:true*/` and `/*jslint node:true*/` to set the environment in files. This feature was undocumented and has been replaced with `/*eslint-env node */` to set the environment in files. See [#759](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/759).
* The 0.4.x releases of ESLint had a licensing issue with a dependency of Optionator that was had no license applied to it, making ESLint's license picture a bit muddy. We upgraded to the latest version of Optionator, in which the offending module has been removed, returning ESLint's license to pristine shape. Even though functionality did not change due to this, the license story for ESLint did, and so we consider it a breaking change.

## New Rules

* Rule: [valid-typeof](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/valid-typeof) by Ian Christian Myers

* Add options for rule 'no-unused-vars' to check all arguments in functions (fixes [#728](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/728)) (Aliaksei Shytkin)
* Rule block-scoped-var works correct with object properties (fixes [#755](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/755)) (Aliaksei Shytkin)
* Fixes [#740](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/740) - Make sure callbacks exist before marking them as 'handled'. (mstuart)
* fixes [#743](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/743): wrap-regex rule warns on regex used in dynamic member access (Michael Ficarra)
