# ESLint 0.13.0 released

We just pushed ESLint 0.13.0, which is a minor release upgrade. This release includes new features and bug fixes.

## Highlights

This is a summary of the major changes you need to know about for this version of ESLint.

### More ECMAScript 6 support

0.13.0 adds more support for several ECMAScript 6, including:

* Template strings
* Default parameters
* Unicode code point escapes

All of these options are off by default, and you can enable them in your configuration file. See [Configuring ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring) for more information.

### Breaking: Block scoping

Additionally, 0.13.0 has full support for block scoping (`let` and `const`), so all scope-related rules should work the way you expect. This is a breaking change because if you were previously using `let` and `const`, the scope was being calculated incorrectly, and that may result in different behavior than in 0.13.0.

### Deprecating global-strict and no-extra-strict

The `global-strict` and `no-extra-strict` rules have been deprecated in favor of adding this functionality into the `strict` rule. We suggest you upgrade to using the updated `strict` rule as soon as possible. The `global-strict` and `no-extra-strict` rules will be removed when 1.0.0 is released.
