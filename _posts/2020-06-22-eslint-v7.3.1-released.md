We just pushed ESLint v7.3.1, which is a patch release upgrade of ESLint.

The v7.3.0 release included a fix for an unrelated issue that caused a configuration issue in `eslint-config-airbnb` that had previously gone unnoticed to start failing. ESLint expects configurations to be JSON-serializable, so configurations that use `Infinity` or other non-JSON-serializable values may cause undefined behavior in some parts of ESLint including caching and the `--print-config` command line argument. In this case, the use of `Infinity` was not caught until now due to a gap in the JSON schema validator that ESLint uses for which a fix has been implemented and is awaiting release.

In order to give users time to upgrade to an updated version of `eslint-config-airbnb` when it becomes available, this v7.3.1 release includes a temporary workaround for `Infinity` that will allow linting to continue despite the undefined behavior elsewhere.
