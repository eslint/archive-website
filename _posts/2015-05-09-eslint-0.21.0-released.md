# ESLint 0.21.0 released

We just pushed ESLint 0.21.0, which is a minor release upgrade. This release includes new features and bug fixes.

## Highlights

This is a summary of the major changes you need to know about for this version of ESLint.

## Config Initialization

Setting up a configuration file for the first time can be difficult, and we're trying to make it easier. That's why we've added the `--init` command line flag. Using this flag, you'll be walked through a series of questions to setup the basic information in your config file. For example:

```
$ eslint --init
? What style of indentation do you use? Spaces
? What quotes do you use for strings? Double
? What line endings do you use? Unix
? Do you require semicolons? Yes
? Are you using ECMAScript 6 features? Yes
? Where will your code run? Browser
? Do you use JSX? No
? What format do you want your config file to be in? YAML
Successfully created .eslintrc file in c:\Users\Nicholas\projects\personal\tmp
```

We hope this new feature will help get people started with ESLint faster.

## Config Inheritance

Another feature we've added is the ability to inherit configuration settings. Now, you can use `extends` to specify another file from which you want to inherit settings. For example:

```json
{
    "extends": "../../config/myconfig.json"
}
```

Read more in the [documentation](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring#extending-configuration-files).

## Shareable Configs

Rounding out our configuration changes is the ability to package up and share your configuration information with others. Shareable configs are simply npm packages that export an object containing your configuration preferences. You can then use `extends` to bring those settings into your project. See the [documentation](https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/shareable-configs) for more information.

### 1.0.0 Update

Some of our plans for 1.0.0 have shifted due to some last minute feedback. The new list of changes for 1.0.0 is [now available](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3Av1.0.0).

The biggest notable change from the previous list is [#2100](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/2100), which will make `--reset` the default behavior of ESLint. We've had a lot of feedback that the default rules are a significant pain point, so in 1.0.0 we won't have any rules enabled by default. See the issue for more discussion.

Reminder: we are preparing a list of breaking changes that will be coming in v1.0.0 and are tracking them on [#1898](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/1898). Stay tuned to that issue so you know what to expect.
