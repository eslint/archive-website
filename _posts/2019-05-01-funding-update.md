# Funding ESLint's Future: An Update

Back in February, we [announced](https://eslint.org/blog/2019/02/funding-eslint-future) the creation of the [ESLint Collective](https://opencollective.com/eslint) to raise funds for the ongoing maintenance and development of ESLint. At the time, we were grateful to have both [Facebook Open Source](https://code.facebook.com/projects/) and [Airbnb](https://airbnb.com) as our first two gold sponsors, each donating $1,000 per month.

In the past three months, we are happy to share that our monthly donations have reached over $7,000, 35% of the way towards our $20,000 goal. That's an amazing achievement in such a short amount of time, and we are humbled that so many have reached out to support ESLint.
