# ESLint v2.4.0 released

We just pushed ESLint v2.4.0, which is a minor release upgrade of ESLint. This release adds some new features and fixes several bugs found in the previous release.

## Highlights

This is a summary of the major changes you need to know about for this version of ESLint.

### babel-eslint Compatibility Fix

The v2.3.0 release introduced a change that broke compatibility with `babel-eslint`. We realize that a lot of you depend on `babel-eslint` and so we wanted to make sure to restore compatibility as quickly as possible. We couldn't undo the change that cause the problem as it would have caused a regression for ESLint, and it took us some time to figure out the right approach to solve the problem.

With v2.4.0, `babel-eslint` compatibility is now restored with a permanent solution that should prevent this from happening again. We appreciate your patience as we tried to determine the best long-term solution.
