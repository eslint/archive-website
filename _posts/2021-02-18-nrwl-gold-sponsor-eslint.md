We are happy to share that [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) has become an ESLint gold sponsor sponsor, donating $1,000 each month for the ongoing maintenance and development of ESLint! The Chrome team is well known for supporting web developers around the world through not just developing the browser, but also through resources like [web.dev](https://web.dev), where they document and explain the latest web technologies.

Here's what the folks at Nrwl had to say about ESLint:

> "Nx uses ESLint to enforce code quality, library boundaries, and project visibility constraints. ESLint makes Nx more powerful, so on behalf of the Nx.dev community, we're proud to do our part and sponsor ESLint's continued success!"
> -- Jeff Cross, Co-founder and Principal Architect at Nrwl
>
> "We help many companies build large systems using Nx. To keep them maintainable, it's important to follow community and org-specific best practices, and ESLint makes it easy."
> -- Victor Savkin, Co-founder at Nrwl

ESLint is grateful for the support of the Nrwl team and we are putting these funds to work by paying more contributors to help maintain and develop ESLint. Due to the support of companies like Nrwl, ESLint is well-positioned to continue being actively maintained for the foreseeable future.
