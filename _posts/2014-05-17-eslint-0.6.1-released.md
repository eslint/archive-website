# ESLint 0.6.1 released

We just pushed ESLint 0.6.1, which is bug fix release.

## Deprecation Notices

* **Reminder:** The 0.6.x ESLint will be the last to support the deprecated JSON format for `.eslintignore`. This was deprecated in 0.5.1 and will be removed in 0.7.0. Please change your `.eslintignore` files to the new plain-text format. See [#761](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/761).

## Upgrades
