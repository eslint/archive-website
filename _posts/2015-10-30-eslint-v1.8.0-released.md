# ESLint v1.8.0 released

We just pushed ESLint v1.8.0, which is a minor release upgrade of ESLint. This release adds some new features and fixes several bugs found in the previous release.

## Highlights

Here are some highlights of changes in this release.

### New Rules

* [`no-arrow-condition`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-arrow-condition)
* [`arrow-body-style`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/arrow-body-style)

### Autofixing

The following rules have been updated to include autofixing:

* [`comma-spacing`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/comma-spacing)

### Caching Enhancements

If you've been using the `--cache` feature, it will now optionally create a directory for your cache instead of a file. This change means that it's possible to use a single cache for every project you work on rather than one cache per project.

To facilitate this change, we are deprecating `--cache-file` in favor of `--cache-location`, which can accept either a file path or a directory (be sure to include the trailing slash to indicate a directory). The `--cache-file` flag will be removed in v2.0.0.

Read more in the [documentation](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/command-line-interface#caching).

### RuleTester Enhancement

The `RuleTester` just got a bit smarter. It will now verify that the AST was not modified during execution of a rule. This was added as it's possible for rules to accidentally modify the AST during execution, and that modification can negatively affect other rules. The `RuleTester` will now fail any test that modifies the AST.
